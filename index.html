                    <img src="abhi1.jpg" alt = "Profile-pic"/>
                    <p>I am currently doing my Master's in Computer Engineering in University of Texas at Dallas.
                        Currently I am working as a Graduate Student Worker in IDEA lab working on a project on 
                        employing Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for automated detection and diagnosis of Epilepsy using EEG signals and implement the CNN on FPGA to design a full embedded system.
                        Previously I was working as a Software Engineer in Automation and Control group of ACE Designers Ltd which was responsible
                        for developing in-house CNC system. I was involved in development of front-end safety critical applications in automative industry.
                        My responsibilities included developing core code, fixing bugs, troubleshooting and performing software maintainance.

                    <h3><strong>About</strong></h3>  
                    <p>
                        During my four years of undergraduate study in Electronics and Communication Engineering at
                        BMSCE I got sound knowledge and basic understanding of concepts about the subjects of Digital
                        Electronics, Microcontrollers, and Computer Architecture and wanted to pursue my interests
                        towards those fields, hence I took up elective courses Embedded Systems, Operating System
                        Concepts, Digital Design using VHDL and Network Security which has equipped me with the
                        necessary prerequisites for this graduate course. I always strived hard to keep myself abreast of the
                        latest trends by going through the top IEEE journals like IEEE Transactions on communications
                        and explore articles on Embedded Systems through the free facilities provided by my college. To
                        further enhance my skills I used to participate in Technical contests and attend seminar talks related
                        to my interests and was an active member in my institutionâ€™s Propel Lab where a community of
                        enthusiastic people used to work on exciting Embedded systems projects. Continuing my interest in
                        this field my final year undergrad project was on VANET based Vehicular applications, one
                        such application was Autonomous Room mapping robot. The goal was to make an autonomous
                        robot to able to construct a floor map around its surroundings based on an algorithm I and my
                        team-mate had developed and establish wireless communication with host PC and receive coordinate
                        values which were used in MATLAB code to generate a Real-time graphical map of the
                        arena. This project was well appreciated by my professors and helped me a lot in giving a deeper
                        insight into the architecture and working of micro-controller and helped improve my Embedded C
                        programming skills.
